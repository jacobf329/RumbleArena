REM Gets the latest version of the game.
REM
REM This runs itself from a copy in the temp folder. An updater that replaces
REM the files it is running from is an updater that crashes halfway: cmd re-reads
REM a batch file from a byte offset between commands, so rewriting this file
REM mid-run makes it execute whatever now happens to sit at that offset.
REM Working from a copy is what makes the whole install replaceable, launcher
REM included. (PowerShell parses a script fully before running it, so the update
REM script only needs the same treatment to survive its own folder being
REM swapped out.)
